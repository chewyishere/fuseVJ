Syphon for Open Frameworks, Public Beta 2
=========================================

About
-----

Syphon is a system for sending video between applications. You can use it to send high resolution and high frame rate video, 3D textures and synthesized content between your openFrameworks application other applications and environments.

Syphon for openFrameworks includes one add-on with two new objects, ofxSyphonClient & ofxSyphonServer. 

ofxSyphonClient - brings frames from other applications into openFrameworks wrapped in an ofTexture, which can be bound and drawn like any ofTexture.

ofxSyphonServer - allows ofTextures and the whole GLUT scene to be named and published to the system, so that other applications which support Syphon can use them.
